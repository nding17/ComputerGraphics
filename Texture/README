Hi there,

I have made a wrapper program so that users
would be able to wrap images over various 
geometries. There're three shapes I have
implemented. They are cube, cylinder and sphere. 
By clicking the texture buttons, you could see
how the images are mapped onto three different 
shapes. In the end, you can rotate the shapes
to see how the texture mappings look overall. 

For the cube mapping, I implemented the bilinear
mapping introduced in your book. And for the 
sphere and cylinder mapping, I used the direct
mapping as you taught us during one of the classes.
Since Cube texture mapping is a lot more complicated,
I created a separate class called TextureCube to 
solely work for the bilinear mapping technique.
Currently, box texture looks best.

One tricky part happened in the rotation of spheres
and cylinders was that it is easy to go over the 
dimensions of the images. So the circumstance for
the circles is technically R(2*PI - EPSILON), where
EPSILON is a very small number to prevent the rotation
from going overboard. 

All the input images could be found in the [img]
folder, and of course the dimensions of the shapes
are determined by the sizes of the images. Also, 
image credits are included in this folder.

Finally, thank you so much for teaching us a wonderful 
block. I really learned and enjoyed a lot during this 
course, and hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving break!

best,
Nelson
